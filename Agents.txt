tool_context – The context of the tool.

llm_request – The outgoing LLM request, mutable this method.

class google.adk.tools.FunctionTool(func)
Bases: BaseTool

A tool that wraps a user-defined Python function.

func
The function to wrap.

async run_async(*, args, tool_context)
Runs the tool with the given arguments and context.

NOTE :rtype: Any

Required if this tool needs to run at the client side.

Otherwise, can be skipped, e.g. for a built-in GoogleSearch tool for Gemini.

Parameters:
args – The LLM-filled arguments.

ctx – The context of the tool.

Returns:
The result of running the tool.

class google.adk.tools.LongRunningFunctionTool(func)
Bases: FunctionTool

A function tool that returns the result asynchronously.

This tool is used for long-running operations that may take a significant amount of time to complete. The framework will call the function. Once the function returns, the response will be returned asynchronously to the framework which is identified by the function_call_id.

Example: `python tool = LongRunningFunctionTool(a_long_running_function) `

is_long_running
Whether the tool is a long running operation.

class google.adk.tools.ToolContext(invocation_context, *, function_call_id=None, event_actions=None)
Bases: CallbackContext

The context of the tool.

This class provides the context for a tool invocation, including access to the invocation context, function call ID, event actions, and authentication response. It also provides methods for requesting credentials, retrieving authentication responses, listing artifacts, and searching memory.

invocation_context
The invocation context of the tool.

function_call_id
The function call id of the current tool call. This id was returned in the function call event from LLM to identify a function call. If LLM didn’t return this id, ADK will assign one to it. This id is used to map function call response to the original function call.

event_actions
The event actions of the current tool call.

property actions: EventActions
get_auth_response(auth_config)
Return type:
AuthCredential

list_artifacts()
Lists the filenames of the artifacts attached to the current session.

Return type:
list[str]

request_credential(auth_config)
Return type:
None

search_memory(query)
Searches the memory of the current user.

Return type:
SearchMemoryResponse

class google.adk.tools.VertexAiSearchTool(*, data_store_id=None, search_engine_id=None)
Bases: BaseTool

A built-in tool using Vertex AI Search.

data_store_id
The Vertex AI search data store resource ID.

search_engine_id
The Vertex AI search engine resource ID.

Initializes the Vertex AI Search tool.

Parameters:
data_store_id – The Vertex AI search data store resource ID in the format of “projects/{project}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection}/dataStores/{dataStore}”.

search_engine_id – The Vertex AI search engine resource ID in the format of “projects/{project}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection}/engines/{engine}”.

Raises:
ValueError – If both data_store_id and search_engine_id are not specified

or both are specified. –

async process_llm_request(*, tool_context, llm_request)
Processes the outgoing LLM request for this tool.

Use cases: - Most common use case is adding this tool to the LLM request. - Some tools may just preprocess the LLM request before it’s sent out.

Return type:
None

Parameters:
tool_context – The context of the tool.

llm_request – The outgoing LLM request, mutable this method.

google.adk.tools.exit_loop(tool_context)
Exits the loop.

Call this function only when you are instructed to do so.

google.adk.tools.transfer_to_agent(agent_name, tool_context)
Transfer the question to another agent.
